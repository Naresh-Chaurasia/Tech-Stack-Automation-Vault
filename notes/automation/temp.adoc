== Jackson Support in Spring Boot

Spring Boot has *built-in support* for Jackson — no need to add the dependency manually in most cases.

==== How It Works

* Spring Boot includes Jackson automatically through the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency.
* It uses Jackson's `ObjectMapper`:
** To serialize Java objects into JSON (for responses).
** To deserialize JSON into Java objects (for requests).

==== Example REST Controller

[source,java]
----
@RestController
public class BookController {

    @PostMapping("/books")
    public String createBook(@RequestBody Book book) {
        return "Book received: " + book.getTitle();
    }

    @GetMapping("/book")
    public Book getBook() {
        Book book = new Book();
        book.setTitle("The Alchemist");
        book.setAuthor("Paulo Coelho");
        book.setPrice(9.99);
        return book; // Automatically converted to JSON by Jackson
    }
}
----

* `@RequestBody` → Jackson deserializes JSON to `Book` object.
* Return value → Jackson serializes `Book` object to JSON.

==== Do You Need to Add Jackson Manually?

No. If you use the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Then Jackson (`jackson-databind`) is included by default.
